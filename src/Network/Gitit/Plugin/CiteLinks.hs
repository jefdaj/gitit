-- TODO OK, something about the CiteProc plugin is messing this up :( find
-- and fix!

{- This plugin supports keeping notes in the style used by Caleb McDaniel
 - (http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/plain-text-citations.html). That is, you have
 - one wiki page per citable source and it contains a `bib` codeblock with
 - its bibtex entry. Separate bibtex files are also supported.
 -
 - If the current page includes a citation and there's a matching wiki page
 - in the same directory, this replaces the citation with a link to that
 - page. The idea is that if you already wrote notes you probably want to
 - go review them instead of jumping straight to the original source.
 -
 - Citations of the current page are ignored. Other bibtex is allowed and
 - will also be ignored (then hopefully passed on to my CiteProc plugin!)
 -
 - TODO need to identify links however CiteProc does it?
 -      it's not just a simple @ followed by letters
 -      if not, document that it probably only works with Markdown
