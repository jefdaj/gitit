maybe the actual messed-up code is in filestore,
but could still band-aid it by reading file contents,
checking if they're a symlink, and loading it instead if so

System.Posix.Files.readSymbolicLink :: FilePath -> IO FilePath,
and then just read the new FilePath instead

isSymbolicLink :: FileStatus -> Book
