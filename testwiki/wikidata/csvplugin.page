title: Csv plugin
...

Here are some tests of the csv plugin, which renders CSV
format spreadsheets as markdown tables.

You can write the spreadsheet in the page:

~~~ { .csv }
id,name,email
1,Firstname Lastname, fake@email.com
~~~

You can also dynamically display another file.
Paths can be relative to the wikidata dir (start with "/"),
or the current page. Here are some tests of the path handling.
They should all look the same:

~~~ { .csv file="test2.csv" }
this is a csv file by path relative to the page
~~~

~~~ { .csv file="/test2.csv" }
this is a csv file by path relative to the repo
~~~

~~~ { .csv file="csvdir/test3.csv" }
this is another one loaded path relative to the page
~~~

~~~ { .csv file="/csvdir/test3.csv" }
this is another one loaded path relative to the repo
~~~

If the file doesn't exist you get an error:

~~~ { .csv file="nonexistent.csv" }
this should print an error
~~~
