title: External plugin
...

Here are some tests of the "external" plugin,
which lets you transform code blocks using arbitrary external programs.

This should run a bash script:

~~~ { .external bin="/bin/sh" fmt="plain" }
echo "hello from $0"
~~~

This should run a python script and format the output as a paragraph:

~~~ { .external bin="/usr/bin/python" fmt="para" }
import sys
print "hello from python", sys.version
~~~

This should generate an error:

~~~ { .external bin="/bin/false" fmt="html"}
this generates an error
~~~
