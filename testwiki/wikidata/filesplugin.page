title: Files plugin
...

This should show a list of files in the same folder as this page
which have `main` but not `swp` in their filenames:

~~~{ .files }
+ main
- swp
~~~


And this should show files in the `dir1` folder with `txt` in their names:

~~~{ .files dir="dir1" }
+ txt
~~~

This should show the one dir inside `dir1` which also has `dir` in its name,
but not `dir3`:

~~~{ .files dir="dir1" }
+ dir
- dir3
~~~
